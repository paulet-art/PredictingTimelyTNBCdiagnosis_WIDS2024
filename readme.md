# Ensemble Model for Predicting Metastatic Cancer Diagnosis

Finished 429/670 teams 

**PRIVATE LEADER BOARD SCORE** : **0.783**   <br>
**PUBLIC LEADER BOARD SCORE** : **0.79**

 Despite initial enthusiasm for feature engineering, I discovered that many features were unrelated to the target variable. Created subsets of features, utilized various models and averaged predictions for robustness.

**Data Insights**
-This competition was different in the sense that the class ratios of positive to negative class were on the positive side. <br>

-ICD-9 and ICD-10 in the Breast Cancer Diagnosis code were the trickiest to identify how to use.
